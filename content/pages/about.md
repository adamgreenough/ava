# About Ava CMS

Ava CMS is a flat-file content management system built for developers who want simplicity and control.

## Philosophy

- **Git is the source of truth** — Content lives in files. Version control handles history.
- **Filesystem is trusted** — No abstraction layers. Files are files.
- **CMS gets out of the way** — No WYSIWYG. No media manager. No guard rails.

## Technical Details

- PHP 8.4+
- Markdown via CommonMark
- YAML frontmatter
- PHP templates
- Cache-first architecture

## Who is this for?

Developers building personal sites, blogs, or small content sites who prefer working with files over databases and admin panels.
