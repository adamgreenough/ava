# Welcome to Ava CMS

Ava (Addy's Very Adaptable CMS) is a flat-file, developer-first CMS for personal sites.

## Features

- **Flat-file**: No database required. Content is Markdown with YAML frontmatter.
- **Fast**: Content indexed to PHP cache files. Runtime reads caches, not Markdown.
- **Flexible**: Custom post types, taxonomies, and fields.
- **Simple**: Readable, dependency-light PHP. No magic.

## Getting Started

1. Edit content in `content/` as Markdown files
2. Customize templates in `themes/default/templates/`
3. Run `php bin/ava status` to see your site

That's it. No build step. No database migrations. Just files.
